Installing openMDAO Offline
---------------------------

This document provides instructions for how to install OpenMDAO on a non-networked computer.


Generating Offline Install Scripts
=====================================

First, two installer scripts must be generated using mkinstaller.py (located in openmdao.devtools).
The first script is used to gather all necessary packages that are required for an openMDAO installation, and place them 
(as .egg files) within a single directory named 'pkg'. This script is generated by passing the command line argument "--offline gather"
to mkinstaller.py.

::

  python openmdao.devtools\src\openmdao\devtools\mkinstaller.py --offline gather
  
The second script is used to actually install openMDAO using these gathered files located within the pkg directory. 
This script is generated by passing the command line argument "--offline installer" to mkinstaller.py.

::

  python openmdao.devtools\src\openmdao\devtools\mkinstaller.py --offline installer

  
Gathering Needed Files
=======================
Next, move the 'gather-go-openmdao' script to a temporary directory on a networked machine with the same 
Python version, OS, and architecture as the machine where the offline installation will be made.
Run the python script, and an installation of openMDAO will be created, along with a directory named 'pkg'. 
Once the script has finished, this installation of openMDAO may be discarded. Only the pkg directory will be needed.

Next, a Python setuptools egg and pip source tar must be downloaded and placed within the pkg directory manually. 

  
Performing the Installation
====================================
Now, move the pkg directory and the generated 'offline-go-openmdao' script to the non-networked machine 
to perform the offline installation. Run the script with the command line arguments '--extra-search-dir=[pkg location]' 
to force virtualenv to look in the specified 'pkg' directory location for the setuptools and pip source. Use the '-f [pkg location]' to force 
setuptools to search the pkg directory for needed source. Use the '--never-download' to ensure all
necessary package installations occur from local sources.
For an example where the 'offline-go-openmdao' script and 'pkg' directory are in the same location, the command would be
::

  python offline-go-openmdao-0.4.0.py --extra-search-dir=pkg -f pkg --never-download
  
openMDAO will then be built from local sources only.
