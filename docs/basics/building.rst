Overview
==========

In this section, you are going to learn a few of the most basic tools you need to build analysis models 
using the OpenMDAO script interface. To get the most out of this tutorial, you should be familiar (though
you don't have to be proficient) with the Python language. If you don't have much experience with Python, we
recommend trying `Dive into Python <http://www.diveintopython.net/>`_. It is an excellent introduction to
Python that is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License, so you can download and use it as you
wish.

We will build a component that models a paraboloid that is a function of two input variables. Then we will 
set up an OpenMDAO model with the paraboloid component. Using that model, we will exercise some of the
basic  features of the OpenMDAO framework, such as connecting inputs and outputs, and working with external
files.  We will also use this same component in the later :ref:`tutorial on optimization
<optimization_tutorial>`.

Naming Conventions
--------------------

Components and variables that are instantiated into the OpenMDAO model 
hierarchy must follow the same naming syntax as attributes in the Python
language. To summarize, they can include only alphanumeric
characters and the underscore, and the lead character cannot be a number.
Any attempt to create a component or a variable that does not conform
to Python's syntax will result in an exception.  OpenMDAO checks for
compliance when a variable or Component instance is created:

    >>> from openmdao.main.api import Assembly
    >>> from openmdao.examples.enginedesign.chassis import Chassis
    >>> top = Assembly()
    >>> top.add('chassis1',Chassis())
    <openmdao.examples.enginedesign.chassis.Chassis object at ...
    >>> top.add('the chassis',Chassis())
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    NameError: name 'the chassis' contains illegal characters

In the OpenMDAO source and examples, we've tried to follow the `PEP 8
<http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ standard, which specifies a naming
convention for component instance names and variable names. For all
variable names, PEP 8 prescribes the use of lower case names with words
separated by underscores. Naturally, PEP 8 compliance is not a requirement
that will be forced on users, but it is a good style guideline.

Building a Component - Paraboloid
==================================

A component takes a set of inputs and operates on them to produce a set of
outputs. In the OpenMDAO architecture, a class called *Component*
provides this behavior. Any Component has inputs and outputs and
contains a function called *execute* that calculates the outputs based on the
values of the inputs. Let's take a look at how you would implement the
paraboloid as an OpenMDAO component:

.. testcode:: simple_component_Paraboloid

    from openmdao.main.api import Component
    from openmdao.lib.datatypes.api import Float
    
    
    class Paraboloid(Component):
        """ Evaluates the equation f(x,y) = (x-3)^2 + xy + (y+4)^2 - 3 """
    
        # set up interface to the framework  
        x = Float(0.0, iotype='in', desc='The variable x')
        y = Float(0.0, iotype='in', desc='The variable y')

        f_xy = Float(0.0, iotype='out', desc='F(x,y)')        

        
        def execute(self):
            """f(x,y) = (x-3)^2 + xy + (y+4)^2 - 3
                Minimum: x = 6.6667; y = -7.3333
            """
        
            x = self.x
            y = self.y
        
            self.f_xy = (x-3.0)**2 + x*y + (y+4.0)**2 - 3.0

To implement a component in the OpenMDAO framework, you write some Python
code and place it in a file. This file is called a *module* in Python.
Typically, a module will contain one component, although you can include more
than one component in a single file. 

In Python, a class or function must be imported before it can be used. Most of what you need in OpenMDAO
can be imported from: ``openmdao.main.api`` and the ``openmdao.lib`` api modules: 
``openmdao.lib.caseiterators.api``, ``openmdao.lib.caserecorders.api``,
``openmdao.lib.components.api``,  ``openmdao.lib.datatypes.api``, ``openmdao.lib.doegenerators.api``,
``openmdao.lib.drivers.api``, and ``openmdao.lib.surrogatemodels.api``.

The first two lines in the ``paraboloid.py`` module import the definitions
of the Component class and the Float class. You will use these in the definition
of your Paraboloid class. Open an editor and create a file called ``paraboloid.py``.
Type these two lines into that file:

.. testcode:: simple_component_Paraboloid_pieces

    from openmdao.main.api import Component
    from openmdao.lib.datatypes.api import Float
    
There are many other objects you could import from ``openmdao.main.api`` and ``openmdao.lib.datatypes.api``, but you
only import the classes that you need for your particular component to keep things neater. In other words:

.. testcode:: package

    # BAD
    from openmdao.main.api import *
    
    # INCONVENIENT
    import openmdao.main.api
    
    # GOOD
    from openmdao.main.api import Component

The next line defines a class called *Paraboloid:*

.. testcode:: simple_component_Paraboloid_pieces

    
    class Paraboloid(Component):
        """ Evaluates the equation f(x,y) = (x-3)^2 + xy + (y+4)^2 - 3 """
    
.. index:: classes, functions

You define the Paraboloid class by deriving it from the Component class. All of your analyses 
will derive from the Component class and typically there are just two functions that you
provide -- one for initialization (anything that needs to be set up once) and one to execute the
component (calculate the outputs from the inputs.)

Right now, your paraboloid class is defined but has no inputs, no 
outputs, and an ``execute`` function that does nothing. So the next thing you need
to do is define the inputs and outputs in the class definition
by adding these lines:

.. testcode:: simple_component_Paraboloid_pieces

        # set up interface to the framework  
        x = Float(0.0, iotype='in', desc='The variable x')
        y = Float(0.0, iotype='in', desc='The variable y')

        f_xy = Float(iotype='out', desc='F(x,y)')

.. index:: Traits

In Python, all objects have *attributes*, but making all of those attributes
visible to the framework would be overwhelming, so OpenMDAO requires you to
declare what we call *Variables* to indicate the specific inputs and outputs
that you want your component to make available to other components. Variables
are usually declared in the class definition of a component.

In this example, all of your inputs and outputs are floating point numbers, so
you will use a type of variable called *Float*. The Float constructor contains
a default value and some arguments. The default value has been set to zero for
the `x` and `y`.

The argument *iotype* declares this variable as an input or an output. This
argument is required. If it is omitted (or misspelled), then the variable
won't be visible in the framework.

The argument *desc* contains a description, or a string of text that describes this
variable. This argument, while not required, is encouraged.

Finally, you need a function to execute this component:

.. testcode:: simple_component_Paraboloid_pieces

    def execute(self):
        """f(x,y) = (x-3)^2 + xy + (y+4)^2 - 3
        Optimal solution (minimum): x = 6.6667; y = -7.3333
        """
        
        x = self.x
        y = self.y
        
        self.f_xy = (x-3.0)**2 + x*y + (y+4.0)**2 - 3.0
        
The ``execute`` function is where you define what a component does when it runs.
For your Paraboloid component, the equation is evaluated here. The input and
output variables are attributes of the Paraboloid class, which means that
they must be accessed using *self*. For example, ``self.x`` gives you the value
stored in x. This ``self.`` can be cumbersome in a big equation, so a pair of
internal variables, *x* and *y*, are used in the calculation.

Often, you will already have the code for evaluating your component outputs,
but it will be in some other language, such as Fortran or C/C++. The :ref:`Plugin-Developer-Guide` 
gives some examples of how to incorporate these kinds of components into OpenMDAO.

To make sure this component works, try running it. The first thing you must do before 
running OpenMDAO is to activate the environment. You need to do this anytime you want 
to run code in OpenMDAO. If you can't remember how to activate your environment, then refer to the 
instructions in the section on :ref:`installation <Installation>`.

Once you have activated your environment, you can run the Python interpreter by typing
::

    python

at the command prompt. Now you will create an instance of your Paraboloid component,
set a new value for each of the inputs, run the component, and look at the output.

::

    >>> from paraboloid import Paraboloid
    >>> my_comp = Paraboloid()
    >>> my_comp.x = 3
    >>> my_comp.y = -5
    >>> my_comp.run()
    >>> my_comp.f_xy
    -17.0

If you have done everything correctly, you should also get ``-17.0`` as the solution.    

The Paraboloid component is now built and ready for inclusion in a larger model. If you want to download
our version of this file, you can find it

OpenMDAO Package Hierarchy
---------------------------

*Package* is a Python concept that provides a structure for organizing
variables and functions in a logical hierarchical fashion. Packages allow you
to import needed functions and class definitions into the Python environment
using dotted module names, where the branch levels are separated by a period
("."). OpenMDAO is made up of several packages. You've already imported class
definition from one of them in your Paraboloid definition. 

:: 
    
    from openmdao.main.api import Component

    
The OpenMDAO package hierarchy includes several subpackages, all of which are prefixed by 
"openmdao.":

- ``openmdao.main`` -- core infrastructure for the framework
- ``openmdao.lib`` -- OpenMDAO's standard library, containing some important plugins (drivers, traits, etc.) that are available to users of the framework
- ``openmdao.units`` -- unit definition and conversion
- ``openmdao.examples`` -- tutorials and example problems for learning OpenMDAO
- ``openmdao.util`` -- utilities used by OpenMDAO but can also be used standalone
- ``openmdao.test`` -- functions and classes used strictly for unit testing

OpenMDAO users and component developers will likely need only the first three of these (``main,
lib,`` and ``units``). Importing classes and functions from OpenMDAO's libraries is performed with
the same syntax as loading any other Python module:

.. testcode:: package

    from openmdao.main.api import Component, Assembly
    from openmdao.lib.drivers.api import CONMINdriver

Here, the fundamental OpenMDAO component classes *Component* and *Assembly* are
loaded from ``openmdao.main.api``, along with the CONMIN driver from ``openmdao.lib.drivers.api``.

To simplify the imports, a selection of the most commonly used imports was placed in the
pseudo-package ``openmdao.main.api``. You can obtain a complete list of what is available in this
module by looking at the  :ref:`Source Documentation<source_documentation>`. 

Importing more objects into the namespace of your module increases the
likelihood of name collision, so you should import only the objects that you need.
You should avoid using ``from <modname> import *`` because it puts every object
from the given module into the current namespace. 

.. testcode:: package

    # BAD
    from openmdao.main.api import *
    
    # INCONVENIENT
    import openmdao.main.api
    
    # GOOD
    from openmdao.main.api import Component, Assembly, Driver
