""" Decorator for drivers that need to take derivatives (either gradients or
    Hessians) of their workflow. The following delegates are available:
    
    UsesGradients - if you need first derivatives
    
    UsesHessians  - if you need second derivatives
    
    From a driver's perspective, derivatives are needed from its parameters
    to its objective(s) and constraints.
