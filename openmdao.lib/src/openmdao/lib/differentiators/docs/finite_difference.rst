.. index:: Differentiators, FiniteDifference

A `differentiator` is a special object that can be used by a driver to calculate
the first or second derivatives of a workflow. The derivatives are calculated
from the parameter inputs to the objective and constraint outputs. Any driver
that has been derived from the DriverUsesDerivatives base class contains a slot (i.e., Instance trait)
called `Differentiator`. This slot can take a Differentiator object.

.. _FiniteDifference:

*FiniteDifference*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``FiniteDifference`` differentiator provides the gradient vector and Hessian
matrix of the workflow using the finite difference method. For first derivatives,
you have a choice of forward, backward, or central differencing. Second
derivatives are calculated using the standard three-point difference for both
on-diagonal and off-diagonal terms.

The ``FiniteDifference`` differentiator can be used with the CONMIN or NEWSUMT
optimizer by plugging it into the differentiator socket.

The only argument that ``FiniteDifference`` takes is the driver you are plugging into.

``FiniteDifference`` has two additional control variables. The ``form`` parameter is used to declare
which difference the first derivative will use. (The default is ``'central'``.) The ``default_stepsize`` parameter is used to set a
default finite difference step size. Note that you can declare a separate finite difference step size
for each parameter in the call to ``add_parameter``. Here, the finite difference step size for the input
``'x'`` to paraboloid is set to .01. If you don't specify ``fd_step`` for a parameter, then the default
step size is used.

Fake Finite Difference is fully supported by the finite difference generator.
