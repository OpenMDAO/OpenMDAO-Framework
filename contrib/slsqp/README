This directory contains the Fortran 77 source for 
SLSQP, plus two helper files called openunit.f and
closeunit.f to manipulate Fortran units from Python.

For OpenMDAO, the source was modified to allow for writing
to unit 6 as STDOUT. Also, all "SAVE" statments were
removed and replaced with storage in the parent
subroutine so that the code could be made thread-safe.
In other words, this driver is now nestable.
