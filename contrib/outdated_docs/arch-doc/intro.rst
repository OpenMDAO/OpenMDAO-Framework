This document describes the initial architecture of OpenMDAO, which is the next
generation open source (OS) Multidisciplinary Analysis and Optimization (MDAO)
Framework being developed under NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program (FAP)
Subsonic Fixed Wing Project. 


Identification
===============

This initial architecture is based on the MDAO requirements submitted in January
2008 and prioritized in subsequent months. The requirements prioritization was
completed in mid-September 2008. The requirements leading to the OS MDAO
framework design can be found in the MDAO *Software Requirements Specification*. Note however that the
requirements mentioned there cover not only the framework but also a number of
engineering tools meant to be integrated into the framework. Since the OS MDAO
framework is under development, only a document ID (MDAO-Architecture) exists at
this time. No document number, version number, release number, or other
applicable data are currently available. Additional identification information
will be included in future versions of this document as it becomes known.


Purpose  
========

This document concentrates only on the architecture of the open source framework
itself and the interfaces between the framework and the engineering tools. This
document is intended to be used by the MDAO Working Group and will be updated as
needed.

System Overview
===============

NASA's Fundamental Aeronautics Program, under the Aeronautics Research Mission
Directorate (ARMD), has a top-level goal to develop system-level,
multidisciplinary capabilities for both civilian and military applications. To
work toward achieving this goal, the Subsonic Fixed Wing Project has an
overarching objective to develop fast and effective physics-based
multidisciplinary analysis and design tools with quantified levels of uncertainty
that enable virtual access to the flight envelope and virtual expeditions
through the design space. NASA is investing in this effort to improve in-house
analysis and design capabilities important for guiding technology investment in
fundamental aeronautics areas.

*Vision and Scope Document.*
