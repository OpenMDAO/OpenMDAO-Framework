Design Principles
-----------------

This section provides a brief outline of some of our requirements and the
general approaches we intend to use to meet them. Some of the  specific
libraries and tools mentioned may change as the design of the framework evolves.


**Flexibility**
    - Interfaces and adaptors

**Ease of extensibility**
    - Plugins (easy to obtain and distribute via a package index e.g., PyPI)

**Portability**
    - Use of Python

**100% open source infrastructure**
    - Python's many open source libraries

**Location transparency**
    - Abstract Factory design pattern
    - Proxy objects
