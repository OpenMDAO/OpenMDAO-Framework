"""
Support for interacting with ModelCenter via the AnalysisServer protocol.
Client-mode access to an AnalysisServer is provided by the 'client', 'factory',
and 'proxy' modules.  Server-mode access by ModelCenter is provided by the
'server' and 'wrapper' modules.

An extension to the protocol allows 'eggs' to pe 'published': the egg is sent
to the server and made part of the server's set of supported components.
