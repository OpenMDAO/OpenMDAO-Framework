"""
This package is intended to contain tools that operate on the openmdao
source repository in some fashion.  For example, scripts used to generate
an openmdao release and upload it to the server are here.  The documentation
building script is also here.  Since the source repository is required in 
order to use any of these tools, this package will never be included in
an openmdao release.
