Test: Files Tab
Location: Filetree( Left-panel in workspace )
Feature: Highlighting

The files listing in the file tree should not be highlighted in the following instances:

1) When the workspace is loaded for the first time
2) When hidden files are toggled to be viewed/hidden
3) When the only files that are updated are
    a) anything in '_macros/*'
    b) any file with the following file extensions
        i) '.pyd' - python dynamically linked library (DLL)
        ii) '.pyc' - compiled python file

To verify that this feature is working correctly, complete the following steps.
If behavior is experienced that does not match the desired results of any 
step that says 'ensure', the test should end, and the behavior should be issued
as a bug. 

1) Load a project
2) Immediately click the files tab while the workspace is loading.
3) Ensure that the listing of files does not highlight.
4) Right click in the file tree and select 'toggle hidden files'
5) When the tree is refreshed to display the files, ensure the list does not highlight.
6) Right click in the file tree and select 'toggle hidden files'
7) When the tree is refreshed to hide hidden files, ensure the list does not highlight.
8) Perform any action that would only update the macro file. Examples of such actions include
    a) Adding an assembly/component to the dataflow.
    b) Removing an assembly/component from the dataflow.
    c) Editing the macro file itself.
9) When any of these actions are performed, ensure that the file listing does not highlight.
10) Perform any action that modifies unhidden files. Examples of such actions include:
    a) Modifying a python source file. Such files have a '.py' file extension.
    b) Adding a new file to the file tree.
    c) Deleting a file from the file tree.
    d) Importing files through the code editor.
11) Ensure that any of the above actions causes the file listing to highlight.
