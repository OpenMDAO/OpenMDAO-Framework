1. Add a GeomComponent to the dataflow
2. Upload simple_nozzle.py to the project (located at examples/openmdao.examples.nozzle_geometry_doe/openmdao/examples/nozzle_geometry_doe/simple_nozzle.py)  
2. Double-click the object to bring up its Properties Pane
3. Click on its "Slots" tab.
4. Drag a "PlugNozzleGeometry" to fill the ParametricGeometry slot.
5. Click on the "Outputs" tab.
6. In the "value" column of "geom_out", click "View Geom."
7. Verify that a separate window
	a. A red STL model was loaded (should be a combination of cowl.stl and plug.stl)
	b. That the model is centered
	c. That the model isn't strecthed
	d. That the model rotates in place
