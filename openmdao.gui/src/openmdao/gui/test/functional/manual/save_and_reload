This test verifies that when a a user attempts to save a module that has 
been modified after being imported into a project, he will see a dialog
with the following options:

    Save & Reload - saves the file but forces the project to be reloaded
    Cancel - does not save the file


The test:

1) Start the GUI
2) Add a file to the project that contains a class that inherits from 
   Component, e.g., 
   examples/openmdao.examples.simple/openmdao/examples/simple/paraboloid.py.
3) Drag a Paraboloid onto the dataflow view into the top Assembly and name
   it comp1.
4) Drag a Paraboloid onto the dataflow view into the top Assembly and name
   it comp2.
5) Connect comp1.f_xy to comp2.x
6) Double click the paraboloid.py file to bring up the editor.
7) Add a comment line somewhere in the file.
8) Save the file. You should then be prompted to 'Save & Reload' or 'Cancel'.
9) First click 'Cancel' to verify that the dialog disappears and nothing else
   happens.
10) Save the file and click on 'Save & Reload'.
11) Verify that you still see comp1 and comp2 in the dataflow and that they are
    still connected.
