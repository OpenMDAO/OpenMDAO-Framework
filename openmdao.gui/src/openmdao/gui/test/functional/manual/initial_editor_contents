On OS X there had been an issue with the contents of a file not being displayed
initially.  Resizing the display or editing another file would correctly
refresh the display of the initial file.  Once initially displayed there were
no further problems, even when closing and reopening the editor.

To check:

Start the GUI.
Create a new project.
Load it into the workspace.
Add a file.
Double-click on the file.
Verify that the file contents are shown, not a single blank line.
