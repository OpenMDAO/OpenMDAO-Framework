Test: Files Tab
Location: Library( Right-panel in workspace )
Feature: View Docs through context menu for library item

You should be able to view the docs of any library item by right clicking on the item. This should
produce a context menu with two options, "View Docs" and "View Metadata". Left clicking "View Docs"
should cause a new tab to open in the browser, directed directly to the documentation for that particular
item.

To verify that this feature is working correctly, complete the following steps.
If behavior is experienced that does not match the desired results of any 
step that says 'ensure', the test should end, and the behavior should be issued
as a bug. 

1) Load a project
2) Navigate to the Library column on the right side of the workspace
3) Right click on the button marked as "Assembly".
4) Ensure that a context menu appears with the options "View Docs" and "View Metadata".
5) Left click on the option "View Docs"
6) Ensure that new webpage is loaded either in a new brower or new tab in the same browser.
7) Ensure that that the URL, beyond "http://localhost:<port_number>" is as follows:

    "/docs/plugins/openmdao.main.assembly.Assembly/openmdao.main.html#module-openmdao.main.assembly"
