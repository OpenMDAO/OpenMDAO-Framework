Requests to localhost:8888 will be relayed via 0MQ to a slow responder,
who will take 1-5 seconds to respond.  The tornado app will remain responsive
duriung this time, and when the worker replies, the web request will finish.

A '.' is printed every 100ms to demonstrate that the zmq request is not blocking
the event loop.

ioloop.install() must be called prior to instantiating *any* tornado objects,
and ideally before importing anything from tornado, just to be safe.

install() sets the singleton instance of tornado.ioloop.IOLoop with zmq's
IOLoop. If this is not done properly, multiple IOLoop instances may be
created, which will have the effect of some subset of handlers never being
called, because only one loop will be running.
